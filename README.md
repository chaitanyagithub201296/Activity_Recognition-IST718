# Activity_Recognition-IST718
We are all aware of the benefits of exercising, but do we understand how much exercise is ample to remain fit? Also, how do we make sure that we are continuously maintaining our fitness while we are swamped with mundane routines? Detecting human movements is an important task in various areas such as healthcare, fitness, and eldercare. Motion sensors can provide users, doctors, and related persons with a better understanding about daily physical activities. Smart watches have motion sensors built-in to track the movement of the user. We are going to use such data recorded from smart watches to analyze user lifestyle and whether the activities performed are sufficient to help them maintain their health. We are extracting data from accelerometers and gyroscopes present in the smartwatch sensor for this purpose. To consolidate the object, given the position of the device attached, we would predict the activity being performed.
By the end of this project, we aim to analyze user lifestyle, predict their activities using machine learning and statistical components while enhancing the predictions as well.
